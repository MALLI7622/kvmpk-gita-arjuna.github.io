<span class='paper-title'>Finding Product Placement in YouTube Videos Using Contrastive Learning</span>\
YouTube channel and educational nonprofit to teach machine learning (what it can do, and its limitations) to a general public audience.
Placing products with promotional intent (product placement) in kids videos is a widely debated societal concern. While it is well understood that kids lack the cognitive ability to distinguish between promotions and regular content, the extent to which promotions and content gets mixed on kids video-platforms is unclear. To truly understand the extent of product placement on a platform like YouTube Kids, where thousands of videos get posted every hour, we need a flexible approach. In this research, we propose a new machine learning approach that uses pictures of products on Amazon store to find if these products get placed in videos.
